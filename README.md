Solve the following Goal Programming problem

For the Dewright Co. preemptive goal programming problem summarized in Table 2, note that (1) different penalty weights are assigned within each of the two priority levels and (2) the individual penalty weights (2 and 3) for the first-priority goals have been multiplied by M. These penalty weights yield the following single linear programming model that incorporates all the goals.

Minimize Z = 5yp + 2My2p + 4y2n + 3My3p
12x1 + 9x2 + 15x3 – (y1p – y1n) = 125
5x1 + 3x2 + 4x3 – (y2p – y2n) = 40
5x1 + 7x2 + 8x3 – (y3p – y3n) = 55
xj>=0; yip>=0; yin>=0
